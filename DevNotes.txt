PLEASE KEEP IN MIND
All commands are in the Commands class.
Code that is commented out in a release build will probably be deleted completely deleted 1 or 2 builds later.

 
 TODO
 Implement a muting command -Supersam654 is on the job
 Re-write the server-client communication.
 Add Bukkit Permissions to the permission system.
 Update config information with all of the permission nodes (flatfile)
 Update all references to the Language file. -Supersam654 is on the job.
 Actually add the action to commands, not just the message. -Supersam654 is on the job.
 	Does not include anything server-side
 	Does include command arguments.
 
 
 Permission Nodes I set up:
 NOTE!!! These are all lower case because permission nodes are cases sensitive (last time I checked)
 communitybans.ban.server
 communitybans.ban.community
 communitybans.ban.temp
 communitybans.ban.lookup
 communitybans.kick
 communitybans.mute
 communitybans.messages.ban
 communitybans.messages.login
 communitybans.messages.update

0.4a:
        Added support for Bukkit superPerms

        Changed access for permmanager

0.5a:
        Moved permissions to more logical package

0.6a:

             The string in the language file are not set on load, but setted when they are first used.
             This will keep the memory usage low (as uneeded strings are not loaded) & the keep it fast (as they are not read from the file with every request)
