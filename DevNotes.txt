PLEASE KEEP IN MIND
All commands are in the Commands class.
Code that is commented out in a release build will probably be deleted completely deleted 1 or 2 builds later.

 
 TODO
 Implement a muting command -Supersam654 is on the job
 Re-write the server-client communication.
 Rename everything that says MCBans -Supersam654 is on the job.
 Add Bukkit Permissions to the permission system.
 Update config information with all of the permission nodes (flatfile)
 Update all references to the Language file. -Supersam654 is on the job.
 Actually add the action to commands, not just the message. -Supersam654 is on the job.
 
 
 Permission Nodes I set up:
 NOTE!!! These are all lower case because permission nodes are cases sensitive (last time I checked)
 communitybans.ban.server
 communitybans.ban.community
 communitybans.ban.temp
 communitybans.ban.lookup
 communitybans.kick
 communitybans.mute
 communitybans.messages
