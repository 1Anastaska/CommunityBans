## This is a template for the build in permission system of CommunityBans
## Rename this file to permissions.yml to make it work.
## The setup is really easy
## Groups are just placeholders for permissions
## Players are part of a group
## This system does not know any form of inheritance, and a player can only have 1 group
##

## The groups
groups:
  admin:
    - 'permission.1'

## users
users:
  Hretsam: admin
  supersam654: admin
